A small collection of experiments I wrote using
Mininet and Pox, as part of the university course
"Advanced topics in telecommunications" at the
TU Braunschweig.

You should also notice this for yourself but just to
be explicit: **Do not use this code in production**.
There is no error handling at all and every component
does implement just the bare minimum in order to be runnable.

The code is intened as a learning experience for me as
an author and you as a reader.
